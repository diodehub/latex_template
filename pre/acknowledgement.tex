\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENT} 

Many noble hearts contributed immense inspiration and support for the successful completion of the project. We are unable to express our gratitude in words to such individuals.

The authors would like to express their gratitude to their supervisor, Dr. Jane Doe, for her invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. They would also like to thank their colleagues and friends for their help and encouragement. In addition, they would like to acknowledge the funding agency, XYZ Foundation, for their financial support and the use of their facilities. Finally, the authors would like to thank the participants who generously gave their time and effort to this research. Their contributions were invaluable and greatly appreciated. 

We will be failing in duty if we do not acknowledge with grateful thanks to the authors of  references and other literatures referred in this project.

Last, but not the least, We take pleasant privilege in expressing our heartfelt thanks to our friends who were of precious help in completing this project.
